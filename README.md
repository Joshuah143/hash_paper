# Hashing

I wrote a short paper on the mathmatics of hash functions. It isnt my best work by any means. With any luck I will have to review it and add some more information and clarifactions. You should only need a high school understanding of math to get the paper.

Originally this paper was created as an internal assesment for the IB SL AI math program. I wont detail any licenseing, but please dont just copy. If you are sighting me, consider using sombody who **really** understands what they are talking about.

It only really skims the surface, so with any luck you might make heads or tails of it.

I'm happy to field any comments at all! My email is: [joshua@himmens.com](mailto:joshua@himmens.com?subject=Hashing%20Paper)
